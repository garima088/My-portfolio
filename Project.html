    <h1>PROJECTS</h1>
    <i>I am working on project which is <b>VEHICAL NUMBER PLATE DEDUCTION SYSTEM </b></i>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Developed a system to automatically detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images or video feeds in real-time, primarily for use in security and traffic management systems.</p>
    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <p>Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR): Uses machine learning and image processing techniques to detect, segment, and recognize vehicle number plates.
        Real-time Detection: Capable of identifying number plates in real-time with high accuracy.
        OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Converts image-based number plates into editable and searchable text.
        Integration with Databases: Supports querying and cross-referencing recognized plates with law enforcement databases for tracking stolen vehicles or traffic violations.</p>
    <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
    <p>Python (OpenCV for image processing)
        Machine Learning (TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning model)
        Optical Character Recognition (Tesseract OCR)
        YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection
        SQL for database management</p><br>
